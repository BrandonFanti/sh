He Sells SHells (not really)

Thanks to [Associate Professor Choi, and the Department of Computer Science @ United States Naval Academy](https://www.usna.edu/Users/cs/choi/).
I stumbled into the IT432 public lectures last night, while working on another project (FOWL) involving scapy. [Lecture 12](https://www.usna.edu/Users/cs/choi/it432/lec/l12/lec.html) caught my eye.

I haven't completed bad_server yet, but the exploit looks pretty trivial.

It was time to take the hands-on-shellcode dive at least.

I wish the course covered any of this:
 - stack [canaries/cookies](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/7.1-mitigation_canary/index.html) 
 - defeating DEP(well that one is easy enough)/[SLR/PIE](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/5.1-mitigation_aslr_pie/index.html),
 - any kind of heap exploits (UAF, spraying, etc)
